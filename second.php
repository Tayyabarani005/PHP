<?php
//ECHO AND PRINT 
echo "Yahoo Baba"; //all have same output
echo 'Yahoo Baba';
echo "Yahoo", "Baba"; //two arguments consider as two strings
echo "Yahoo"."Baba"; //used for concatination , consider as one string
echo 2345;
print "Yahoo Baba";
//The difference between print and echo is that echo is faster than print and also print does not take any arguments.
//We can also write
echo '<h1><i>Yahoo Baba</i></h1>' //add html properties heading 1 and wrote in italic
